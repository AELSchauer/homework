How to install:

1) Ensure that you have ruby 2.4.0 installed on your machine.
  * If you do not have Ruby, see this guide [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). If you're on a Mac, recommend homebrew.
  * If you do not have rvm, type `ruby -v` into your terminal to get your Ruby version. It should say 'ruby 2.4.0p0'.
    * If it doesn't, [install rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).
  * Once rvm is installed, type `rvm list` to see all versions of Ruby installed on your machine.
    * If you see 2.4.0, you're good to go!
    * If you do not see 2.4.0, type `rvm install ruby-2.4.0`.

1) Navigate to the root directory in your terminal.

2) Type `bundle install`.

3) Type `ruby lib/silver_plan_solver.rb`. You will get a message when the code is finished running.

4) Open the 'answers.csv' file.
